Non-obvious things discovered while building this SDK, with the evidence that
established them. Each entry exists because getting it wrong cost time or would
have shipped a bug.

## System.Text.Json's source generator discards property initializers

**Severity: high — this ships NullReferenceExceptions to consumers.**

A collection property written the obvious way:

```csharp
public IReadOnlyList<Attack> Attacks { get; init; } = [];
```

deserializes to **`null`**, not to an empty list, when the JSON omits the
property. The `= []` is silently discarded.

Verified with an isolated probe against .NET 10.0.302 — all three cases produce
`null`:

| Case | Result |
|---|---|
| No `required` members, property absent (`{}`) | `null` |
| With `required` members, property absent | `null` |
| Explicit `"items": null` in the JSON | `null` |

This is not specific to `required`, and not specific to omitted properties.

**Why it matters here:** most `Card` fields are category-specific. A Trainer card
has no `attacks` key at all, so `foreach (var a in card.Attacks)` on any Trainer
would have thrown. The contract test
`Deserialize_TrainerCard_MapsTrainerTypeAndEffect` caught it.

**The fix** is a backing field with a coalescing `init` accessor, applied to
every collection on every model:

```csharp
private readonly IReadOnlyList<Attack> _attacks = [];

public IReadOnlyList<Attack> Attacks
{
    get => _attacks;
    init => _attacks = value ?? [];
}
```

This covers all three failure modes at once — absent property, explicit JSON
null, and a null passed by a caller constructing the record by hand. Both are
pinned by tests (`Deserialize_AbsentCollections_AreEmptyNotNull` and
`Construct_WithExplicitNullCollection_CoercesToEmpty`).

**Rule:** any new collection property on a model must use this pattern. A plain
initializer will compile, pass review, and fail at runtime.

## `IDE0005` needs `GenerateDocumentationFile` to run during build

Setting `dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0005.severity = warning` is not enough. Without
`<GenerateDocumentationFile>true</GenerateDocumentationFile>` the build fails
with a meta-error rather than reporting unused usings:

> `CSC : error EnableGenerateDocumentationFile: Set MSBuild property 'GenerateDocumentationFile' to 'true' in project file to enable IDE0005`

The property is therefore set in `Directory.Build.props` for every project, and
test projects suppress the resulting `CS1591` (missing XML comments) via
`NoWarn`.

**Consequence for the global-usings convention:** because `IDE0005` is an error,
a namespace declared in `GlobalUsings.cs` before any code uses it fails the
build. Global usings must be added *alongside* the code that needs them, not up
front. The `TcgDex.CSharpSdk.IntegrationTests` global-usings file is
deliberately empty for this reason until its first test exists.

## EditorConfig directory globs do not reliably match the test projects

This looked correct and did nothing:

```editorconfig
[**/{*.Tests,*.IntegrationTests}/**/*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1707.severity = none
```

`CA1707` kept firing. Analyzer exclusions that must apply to a whole project now
live in that project's `.csproj` as `<NoWarn>`, which is unambiguous:

```xml
<NoWarn>$(NoWarn);CA1707;CS1591;CA1062</NoWarn>
```

Worth remembering generally: a non-matching editorconfig section fails silently
and looks configured.

---

## `CA1707` conflicts with the required test-naming convention

The engineering standards mandate `{Method}_{Scenario}_{Expected}` test names.
`CA1707` ("remove the underscores from member name") flags exactly that. The
rule is suppressed in the test projects only — the convention wins, because the
underscores carry meaning there.

---

## `CA1716`: keeping the type name `Set`

`Set` collides with a VB.NET keyword, which `CA1716` flags. Suppressed for
`Models/*.cs` only, deliberately: the model types mirror TCGdex's own vocabulary
(`Card`, `Set`, `Serie`) so the SDK surface maps one-to-one onto the API
reference. Renaming to `CardSet` would break that correspondence for anyone
reading both. `CA1716` still applies everywhere else in the SDK.

---

## Multi-targeting `net8.0;net10.0` works with only the .NET 10 SDK installed

No separate targeting pack install was needed — the reference assemblies restore
from NuGet automatically. `net8.0` is the current LTS and `net10.0` is the
newest, so the package covers both without the consumer needing a specific SDK.

`System.Text.Json` is referenced as a package only on `net8.0`; on `net10.0` it
comes from the shared framework.

---

## Test fixtures are recorded live responses, not hand-written JSON

Every file in `TcgDex.CSharpSdk.Tests/Fixtures/` was captured from the live API
and is loaded through the SDK's own `TcgDexJsonContext`, so the tests exercise
the exact serializer configuration that ships.

Hand-written fixtures would have hidden every bug in this document: the
polymorphic `damage` field, the object-array `boosters`, the missing `image` on
`exu-!`, and the initializer problem above were all found because the recorded
payloads are irregular in ways invented test data never is.

See `docs/api-info.md` §9 for what each fixture card is for.
